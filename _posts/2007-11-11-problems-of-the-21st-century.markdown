Problems of the 21st century

In the 21st century, there will be some problems confusion
poeple. Such as pullutions, the disaster of the climate, pool and diseases. But
I think the most problem will be less of labor.




 




Now in China and India, there are too many populations. In
nowadays, many persons are so pool and can't have good education and can't 
find their job. But after 50 years, there will be two many jobs and  no
people to do. 




 




Why I do that prediction?  
The European and North America's
today will be China and India's tomorrow. The advanced country's population's
grow is very slow and even is negative. Labors are shorter and very
expensive.  But China and India have cheap labors to export. After about 50
years, the social has development, the policy to reduce polulation of China will
result in shorter of labors. Populations' reduce and there are too many old
people will be the biggest problem of 21st
century.
